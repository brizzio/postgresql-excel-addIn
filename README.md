PostgreSQL Excel Add-In
====================

PostgreSQL is currently the fastest rising alternative database to commerical products like Oracle or recently aquired database MySQL. PostgreSQL implements strict SQL specifications compared to MySQL's not-so-strict implementation. In some research PostgreSQL is better at performing certain tasks (join/subquerying) than MySQL, but to a large extent, we can consider these two databases equal.

This Excel Add-In provides automatic SQL generation with a GUI for users that are less familiar with SQL syntax.
